## Project Abstract: 
In this project, we will train a classifier model to assign an emotion such as anger or happiness to a given expression using the Face expression recognition dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset). 
This dataset includes grayscale pictures of 7 different expression categories, namely: anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happy, neutral and surprise. 
We will then optimize this model for mobile and develop an android mobile app that uses this model to recognize facial expressions based on photos taken on the phone and/or real-time camera feed of the device.
